Stretch Questions

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        -the float element?
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        -display block:
            1. <h1>-<h6>
            2.<div>
            3.<blockquote>
        -display inline:
            1.<button>
            2.<span>
        -display inline-block:
            1.<img>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        -so the box model is where there is the content, then then the padding outside of that, then the borders outside of the padding, and the margins surround the borders. each box has a box inside of it. 
        the supposed "fix" is called box-sizing.
